# How much JavaScript [do] you need to know to use React?
These subjects I need to know more of before moving onto learning React.

### Callbacks

### Asychronicity in Programming Languages

* programs are synchronous but need the ability to handle input when it comes, which might be in the middle of executing some synchronous code. Some of the ways that this need and others like it are handled is through *interrupts*, *threads*, or *spawning* new processes.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is in general, synchronous and single threaded. However, the environment in which JavaScript is used is not. The browser needs to be able to handle user interactions such as button clicks, mouse events that should cause an action to happen, etc. The browser manages these events through a set of APIs that enables responding to user interactions.

In addition to this, **Node.js** has a *non-blocking I/O* extention to enable file access, network calls, etc.

See, the next two sections, *promises* and *Async/Await*!
