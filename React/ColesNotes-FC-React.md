## Introduction to React

React is a JavaScript library which simplifies developing visual interfaces by dividing the UI into a collection of componenets. This simplifies understanding about an interface and its state at any given point in time. Its core API is small. You only need to understand four concepts to get started:

* Components
* JSX
* State
* Props
