## On Second Thought . . .

Honestly, it might be more useful to quickly go through Flavio Copes "Javascript-beginner-handbook" in the same kind of detail as I have outlined, chapter by chapter, example by example. The idea is that he focusses on the main 80% stuff you actually need. I should master that. This other book is to help me be aware of the troublesome aspects of JS and to avoid those as much as possible, or at least to be aware of how they could bite you.
